## Usage
1. To compile Cython code, enter 'python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace' in the 'bivariate' or 'univariate' directory.
2. Enter 'python3' to start Python in the 'bivariate' or 'univariate' directory.
3. Enter 'import bivariate' for bivariate experiments, and 'import univariate' for univariate experiments.
4. Run experiments using 'bivariate.run(\*args)' and 'univariate.run(\*args)'.
5. Enter 'bivariate.help()' or 'univariate.help()' for more details on how to run the programs.
6. To load experimental results, enter 'bivariate.load(/path/to/result/file)' and 'univariate.load(/path/to/result/file)'.
