# Mathematics and Machine Learning Research
Algorithms from Gaussian distribution research with Dr. Ioannis Panageas from the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

## Steps
1. Use the Cython version for code that is 3X faster than the Python implementation.
2. Make sure you have the dependencies.
3. To compile, enter 'python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace' in the root directory.
4. Enter 'python3' to start Python.
5. To run the program, enter 'import bivariate'.
6. To see the format of the gradient_descent function's arguments, enter 'bivariate.help()'.
7. Run the program using 'bivariate.gradient_descent(...)'
