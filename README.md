# Mathematics and Machine Learning Research
Algorithms from Gaussian distribution research with Dr. Ioannis Panageas from the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

## Usage
- To compile Cython code, enter 'python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace' in the 'bivariate' or 'univariate' directory.
- Enter 'python3' to start Python in the 'bivariate' or 'univariate' directory.
- Enter 'import bivariate' for bivariate experiments, and 'import univariate' for univariate experiments.
- Run experiments using 'bivariate.run(\*args)' or 'univariate.run(\*args)'.
- Enter 'bivariate.help()' or 'univariate.help()' for more details on how to run the programs.
- To load experimental results, enter 'bivariate.view(/path/to/result/file)' or 'univariate.view(/path/to/result/file)'.
- To view the graphs for the Number of Iterations vs. Denominator experiment, enter 'bivariate.plot\_denom(/path/to/bivariate/experiments/experiment\_folder)' and 'univariate.plot\_denom(/path/to/univariate/experiments/experiment\_folder)'.
